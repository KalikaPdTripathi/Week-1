A machine learning-based system that recommends optimal fertilizer types and quantities for various crops based on soil nutrient levels (N, P, K), pH, and environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and rainfall. This project aims to enhance agricultural productivity and promote sustainable farming practices through data-driven insights.
